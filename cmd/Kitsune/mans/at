**[ Kitsune 'at' help page ]**

***Syntax:** `at [time "+3h20m10s"] [-command "ping"] [-repeat "1h"]`*

***Description:*** Schedules an execution of a command after a given time and repeats it if `--repeat` is used.

***Examples:***
    Running ping command after one minute: `at +1m "ping"`

    Searching for an art on danbooru every minute after two minutes: `at -time "+2m" -command "$art -gallery danbooru -tags /"plugsuit/" -amount 1" -repeat "1m"`

***Protips:***
    When you are using the *"* character inside of the command block of `at` please use the character */* before it - otherwise it'll think that your command block ends earlier than it should *(the example above uses that approach)*
