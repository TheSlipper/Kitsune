**[ Kitsune 'mngchan' help page ]**

***Syntax:** `mngchan [-create-channel "channel-name" -type "text" | -remove-channel #tagged-channel | -whitelist-channel #tagged-channel | -blacklist-channel #tagged-channel]`*

***Description:*** Executes an action on a group of channels with  specified names. The available types of actions are - `create-channel`,  `remove-channel`, `whitelist` and `blacklist`. Each of the aforementioned actions may have its own unique action data. `create-channel` and `delete-channel` take no action data which are specified above.

***Examples:***
    Creating a 'channel-name' text channel for a server: `mngchan -create-channel "channel-name" "text"`

    Removing a 'channel-name' channel from a server: `mngchan -remove-channel #channel-name`

    Turning off Kitsune commands in the general chat: `mngchan -blacklist #general`

    Turning on Kitsune commands in the general chat: `$mngchan -whitelist #general`

***WARNING:*** If there is a text channel named the same as a voice channel in a server, Kitsune will always target the text channel instead of the voice channel *(that's because discord doesn't allow tagging voice channels)*.

***Protips:***
  1. You can't tag voice channels with '#' operator on discord but Kitsune will try to find it by its name regardless of that.
