# KITSUNE

## What is Kitsune?

Kitsune is a fully free *(both as in gratis and as in libre)*, simple discord bot targeted at people familiar with UNIX made with [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). 
The goal of this project is creating a bot that grants terminal-like experience for popular discord commands.

## What Kitsune isn't?

Kitsune is neither a program that runs UNIX/GNU+Linux/MacOS/BSD programs on discord nor 
a program that can be used to execute programs from the previously mentioned operating
systems remotely.

## Project status

Project has been reactivated after almost a year of inactivity. The bot is going to be
re-written from scratch in go and the project structure is going to drastically change. 
In other words the bot is in very early stage of development.
